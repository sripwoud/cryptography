# Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption is a family of encryption algorithms that use the **same** cryptographic key(s) for both the encryption of plaintext and the decryption of ciphertext.[^1]

## Application(s)

- Confidentiality: encrypting data so that only parties knowing the secret key can read it.

## Limitations / Caveats

!> A trusted communication channel is required to securely perform the key exchange.

!> It doesn't scale well as performing a private and secure key-exchange between each pair of communicating parties is impractical.\
E.g on the web, a situation where scaling matters, [asymmetric encryption](/primitives/asymmetric-encryption/intro) together with [PKI](/protocols/pki) is rather used to securely exchange keys.
