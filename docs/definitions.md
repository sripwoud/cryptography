| Term               | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Authentication** | Is about making sure that a given entity (with whom you are interacting) is who you believe it to be.[^1]                                                                                              |
| **Authenticity**   | Special case of integrity, where the "reference version" is defined as "whatever it was when it was under control of a specific entity". So it is the combination of integrity and authentication.[^1] |
| **Cipher**         | An algorithm for performing encryption or decryption.[^2]                                                                                                                                              |
| **Ciphertext**     | Result of encryption of _plaintext_. Information that can't be read or understood without the corresponding _cipher_ to decrypt it (that _cipher_ may also require the knowledge of a secret key).[^3] |
| **Decryption**     | The process of decoding _ciphertext_ information via a _cipher_ into a _plaintext_ that reveals the information's true meaning.                                                                        |
| **Encryption**     | The process of encoding _plaintext_ information via a _cipher_ into a _ciphertext_ that hides the information's true meaning.[^4]                                                                      |
| **Integrity**      | The property of data that ensures it has not been altered from some reference version.[^1]                                                                                                             |
| **Plaintext**      | Unencrypted information that can be read and understood by any human.                                                                                                                                  |
